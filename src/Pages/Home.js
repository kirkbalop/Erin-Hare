                    This is where I'd write a bunch of stuff about Erin 
                    had I reached out for approval or suggestions as far 
                    as what should be written. For the time being, so as to have
                    content in the space provided, I'll be leaving this short
                    written blurb about what would usually be written here had the
                    auther checked on what to write.
